 MLOps House Price Prediction Project

#Overview
This project implements a complete MLOps workflow for predicting house prices using machine learning in a local setup. It utilizes a CI/CD pipeline to automate model training, promotion, and deployment, along with monitoring using MLflow. The application is built using Streamlit for user interaction.

#Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Loads house price data from a CSV file.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple machine learning models and logs the results.
- **Model Promotion**: Promotes the best performing model to production using MLflow.
- **Web Application**: Deploys a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
